    "XML is not readable nor a standard in python. YAML is more readable, but JSON is probably the better option. The plugins will be developed in python most of the time. This means that\n",
    "it's easier to dump the dictionary you tested with to json (yaml would require additional dependency). Validating YAML with jsonschema is also unorthodox, as to write a plugin you'll have to switch between the two notations. Lastly, YAML to JSONSchema would sacrifice some JSONSchema features, such as refs.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "`react-jsonschema-form` uses [ajv-validator](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv) which is fast and supports everything we need (including [formats](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/validation/#customformats)).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't do references, conditional validation because plugins define a subschema, but references and conditions need to be defined at root level. We could add them separatelly, but that's a lot of work for a feature we probably don't need.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can see some examples in the \"gui\" folder.\n",
