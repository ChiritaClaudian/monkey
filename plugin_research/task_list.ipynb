    "# Work needed\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 iterations we could do to develop the plugin infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**First iteration** is the bare minimmum we need to have one type of plugins rolling (presumably exploiters).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second iteration** is to support more complex plugins(with options) and different types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Third iteration** is where \"nice to have\" things end up.\n",

    "## First iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Refactor exploiters to plugins (for each exploiter we need):\n",
    "    - [ ] Move logic to common\n",
    "    - [ ] Define configurations\n",
    "    - [ ] Define manifests (this includes the pydantic definitions). Do they need validation?\n",
    "    - [ ] Move smb_download_timeout out of options (we don't support configurable options for first iteration)\n",
    "- [ ] Load the plugins (into the island)\n",
    "    - [ ] Move the files from IM to common, define pyinstaller hooks, etc\n",
    "    - [ ] Define plugin registry, figure out the loading procedure\n",
    "    - [ ] Load the plugins into repositories.We have to validate each config against manifest. We have to store the configs and manifests from the plugins, but also create and save a global configuration.\n",
    "- [ ] Change config reset procedure. On reset we need to re-create the global configuration from the plugin configs stored in repositories.\n",
    "- [ ] Reformat the schema based on the manifests\n",
    "    - [ ] Define manifest resource\n",
    "    - [ ] Create shema parsing method in UI (can be built on top of the prototype). This is the hard part, because of react, safety-checks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Second iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Define pydantic objects for field types\n",
    "- [ ] Validate options upon loading the plugin\n",
    "- [ ] Add more plugins\n",
    "    - [ ] Extract plugin code, configs, manifests\n",
    "    - [ ] Pass only the options required by specific type of plugin. This might require improvements in plugin registry to link plugin type to relevant config options.\n",
    "    - [ ] Fix manifests to alter the UI schema\n",
    "    - [ ] Pass only plugin-specific options when running the plugins. This is already being done, but we might want to do a mapping between plugin type and config options to handle all plugins with a single workflow.\n",
    "- [ ] Adjust the UI to support options\n",
    "    - [ ] Change the advanced select component to support the options. Config schema should stay the same, but we need to show/hide plugin option section on selection. See PluginOptionMock.png file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Third iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Import as many plugins as we can, leave new ones default.\n",
    "- [ ] Build configuration schema. Configuration schema describes all configuration options. Since any interface needs to know these to configure, this comprehensive schema belongs on the back end.\n",
    "    - [ ] Define the common schema (schema defining the non-plugin configuration options)\n",
    "    - [ ] Add plugin manifests to the schema based on plugin type\n",
    "    - [ ] Convert all interfaces (hopefully only web GUI) to fetch this schema and convert it to whatever they understand/expect\n",
    "- [ ] Refactor the config to use the official `react-jsonschema-form` package. Our current package `react-jsonschema-form-bs4` is 3 years old and unmaintained.\n",
    "- [ ] Consider adding more types common to IM domain (port? what else could we predict in future plugins?), apply the ones that are already available (we redifined IPv4, when a validator for that is already available)\n"
